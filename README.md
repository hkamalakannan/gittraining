**Python** is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.

*Python is an interpreted scripting language also. Guido Van Rossum is known as the founder of Python programming.*
